The interest library contains four functions which calculate simple interests, principal, rate and time.
To install the library, use pip_install_interest
After installation, the user must import the library using the syntax import_interest

To use the simple interest function, use the syntax .simple_interest
To use the principal function, use the syntax .principal
To calculte for time, use the syntax .time
To calculate for rate, use the syntax .rate

For the function work, the user must follow the syntax print(si_calc.the function name(the_required_parameters)) to display the result of the function

The parameters required for the simple interest funtion follow the order of principal, rate, time
The values should be entered as integers.

The parameters required for the principal function follow the the order of simple_interest, rate, time
The values should be inputed as integers.

The parameters required for the time function follow the order of simple_interest, principal, rate
The values should be inputed as integers

The parameters required for the rate function should follow the order of simple_interest, principal, time
The values should be entered as integers

Alternatively, the user can import the specific function needed from the library.
To do this, the user myst use the syntax from_interests_import_the prefered function
The user must then follow the syntax print(the_function_name(the the_required_parameters)) to display the result of the function
The values should be inputed in the order stated in the above instruction
The user also has the choice to use aliases when importing the library or individual functions from the library
